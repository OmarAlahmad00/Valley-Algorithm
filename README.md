My Take on the Valley Algorithm From Ford

On March 7th I have coding competition with skills ontario. I was given this algorithm by my dad to practise. I told him to give me something
that would take me a few hours to do. He gave me this and told me this is what he gives his junior engineers at work to do. He told me
that most couldnt even finish it in 6+ hours!!!!

Now, im not sure if he said that in order to make me more confident but who cares.
The code is my take. It could be a lot better as I did it quickly in around 5 minutes. The variable names are stupid and the parameter 
isnt even being used but thats just less than a line of extra code that needs to be added in.
